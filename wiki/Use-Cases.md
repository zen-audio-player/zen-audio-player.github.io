Why would anyone use this?

- Listening to EDM (search youtube for `edm mix` and basically every video has a NSFW thumbnail)
- Listening to anything at work (avoid potential embarrassment when a co-worker/boss sees your screen)
- Listening to anything while studying (avoid being distracted by a music video)
